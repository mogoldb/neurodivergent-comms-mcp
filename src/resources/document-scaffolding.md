# Document Scaffolding

When user asks to scaffold, preview, or analyze a document structure, provide:

## 1. Core Purpose (1 sentence)
What this document is trying to accomplish

## 2. Key Entities
Define main concepts, systems, or terms with brief explanations

## 3. Document Structure Map
List sections and what each covers:
- Section name → What it contains
- Major components → Their relationships

## 4. Required Action/Decision
What the reader needs to do after reading this

## 5. Prerequisite Knowledge
What you need to know before this makes sense:
- Technical concepts
- System context
- Prior decisions

## 6. Reading Strategy
Concrete approach for this specific document:
- Start with: [which section]
- Focus on: [key information]
- Skip if needed: [less critical parts]
- Watch for: [important details]

## Why This Helps
- **ADHD**: Clear focus strategy before diving in
- **Dyslexia**: Structure before detailed reading
- **Executive function**: Reduces cognitive load and overwhelm

## When to Apply
- Long technical documents
- Design docs
- Complex specifications
- Unfamiliar material
- When user says: "scaffold", "preview", "structure", "help me read"
