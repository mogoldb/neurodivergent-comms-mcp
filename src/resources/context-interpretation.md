# Context Interpretation Rules

## Decoding Vague Phrases

### Timeline Phrases
- "When you get a chance" → Usually 1-2 days
- "No rush" → Still has implicit deadline
- "Soon" → Within current sprint/week
- "Eventually" → Lower priority, but not forgotten

### Request Phrases
- "Thoughts?" → Wants specific feedback or approval
- "Can you take a look?" → Wants review/feedback/approval
- "Just checking in" → Needs status update or gentle deadline
- "Let me know" → Wants response even if answer is "not yet"

## Common Patterns
- Polite urgent request - Soft language, hard deadline
- Blocked on you - "When you get a chance" but team is waiting
- Seeking approval - "Thoughts?" means "Can I proceed?"
- Status check - "How's it going?" means "Is this on track?"
