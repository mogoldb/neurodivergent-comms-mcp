## How to Contribute

### Found a Bug?

- If not, open a new issue with:
  - Clear description of the bug
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Expected vs actual behavior
  - Your environment (OS, Python version, AI client)

### Have a Feature Idea?
- Open an issue describing:
  - The communication challenge you're facing
  - How the feature would help
  - Example usage scenarios

### Want to Add a Communication Pattern?
Communication patterns are welcome! Consider:
- **New Tools**: Add functions to `src/server.py`
- **New Resources**: Add rule files to `src/resources/`
- **Better Examples**: Improve `EXAMPLES.md`

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/neurodivergent-comms-mcp.git
cd neurodivergent-comms-mcp

pip install fastmcp

# Test your changes
python src/server.py
```

## Code Guidelines

- **Keep it simple**: This is for neurodivergent users - clarity matters
- **Be specific**: Vague advice isn't helpful
- **Test thoroughly**: Try it with real communication scenarios
- **Document well**: Explain why, not just what
